# WordPress Custom Theme Development Rules

## Project Overview
- Building a custom WordPress theme from scratch
- Using ACF Blocks (not traditional ACF fields)
- Each page section will be a separate ACF block
- Theme will be based on a demo site (screenshots, HTML, CSS provided)
- Only client content will be replaced

## Development Guidelines

### Theme Structure
- Custom theme location: `wp-content/themes/nisson-therapy/` (or custom name)
- Each section = one ACF block
- Blocks should be modular and reusable
- Follow WordPress coding standards (WPCS)

### ACF Blocks
- Use ACF Block API (acf_register_block_type)
- Each block should be self-contained with its own:
  - PHP template file
  - CSS/SCSS file
  - JavaScript file (if needed)
- Blocks should be registered in `functions.php`
- Use block.json for block metadata when possible

### Code Standards
- Follow WordPress PHP Coding Standards
- Use proper escaping and sanitization
- Prefix all functions, classes, and variables with theme prefix
- Use meaningful, descriptive names
- Comment complex logic

### File Organization
- Blocks in: `blocks/` directory
- Each block in its own subdirectory
- Assets (CSS/JS) in: `assets/` directory
- Template parts in: `template-parts/` directory
- Functions and includes in: `inc/` directory

### Security
- Always sanitize user input
- Escape output
- Use nonces for forms
- Follow WordPress security best practices

### Performance
- Enqueue scripts and styles properly
- Use WordPress dependency management
- Optimize images
- Minimize HTTP requests

### Git Workflow
- Custom theme and plugins are tracked in git
- WordPress core and default themes/plugins are ignored
- Use meaningful commit messages
